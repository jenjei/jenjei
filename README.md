# 👋 Hey there, space traveler!

Welcome to my **cosmic coding playground**.
This GitHub is my launchpad for:

- 🚀 **Mobile app experiments:** iOS, and cross-platform tinkering
- 🌐 **Full-stack trials:** web frontends, APIs, and the odd server mishap
- 🛠️ Random ideas that *might* work… eventually
- 💥 A healthy dose of trial & error

---

## 🪐 What to expect here
- Experimental code
- Half-finished side projects
- Curious tech mashups
- Old school projects
- Occasional “accidental” features

My professional work lives at my [other GitHub](https://github.com/jenniylisirnio), though all of it is private due to company projects.
This one’s for exploration, learning, and having fun in the coding cosmos. 🌌
